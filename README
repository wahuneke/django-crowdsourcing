django-crowdsourcing
====================

Django-crowdsourcing is an MIT-licensed survey and report tool for
journalists, supporting many types of survey questions and a wide
variety of reporting options.  A reusable Django application, it is
designed to be installed easily in any Django site, including
multi-site installations.  Its surveys are entirely configured within
the admin interface that ships with Django.

While the primary focus of development is support for crowdsourcing
projects, the survey tool is general purpose and can be used for a
variety of applications.  It is easy enough to handle simple polls
with pie charts, yet powerful enough to handle complicated surveys
with rich multimedia responses plotted on a map with custom icons.

History/Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django-crowdsourcing began life as a fork of Doug Napoleone's
`django-survey`_.  Jacob Smullyan and James Richards started the project;
Dave Smith wrote most of the 1.x version.

Prerequisites are:

 * Django itself, of course -- 1.4 or better.
 * `PIL`_
 * `django-positions`_
 * `sorl-thumbnail`_
 * `flickrapi`_ (optional)

Django-crowdsourcing itself can be installed with `pip`_::

  $ # probably in a virtualenv ...
  $ pip install django-crowdsourcing 

.. _`PIL`: http://pythonware.com/products/pil/
.. _`django-positions`: http://github.com/jpwatts/django-positions 
.. _`sorl-thumbnail`: http://code.google.com/p/sorl-thumbnail/
.. _`pip`: http://pip.openplans.org/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. $ easy_install pip
  2. $ pip install -r crowdsourcing_requirements.txt
